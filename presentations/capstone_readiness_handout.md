# ICS 499: Software Engineering and Capstone Project

**Instructor:** Siva.Jasthi@metrostate.edu

## Capstone Readiness Handout

### What Every Student Should Know Before Starting a Capstone (or Any Software Project)

---

## Why This Matters

A capstone project is not just another class assignment.

**It is your transition from student to professional.**

In industry, no one hands you a perfectly defined problem, unlimited time, or step-by-step instructions. Capstones are designed to prepare you for that reality.

This handout outlines the mindsets, skills, and expectations you should be aware of before you begin.

---

## 1. Focus on the Process, Not Just the Final Product

A working demo is important—but it is not enough.

**You will be evaluated on:**
- How you understood the problem
- How you made design decisions
- How you handled trade-offs
- How you documented your work

> **Key idea:** Engineering is about thinking and reasoning, not just coding.

---

## 2. Expect Ambiguity (and Learn to Handle It)

Real projects often start with:
- Incomplete requirements
- Vague goals
- Unclear constraints

**This is normal.**

**You are expected to:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Make reasonable assumptions
- Adjust as new information emerges

> **Skill to develop:** Turning unclear ideas into concrete tasks.

---

## 3. Control Scope Ruthlessly

One of the most common capstone mistakes is trying to do too much.

**Good teams:**
- Identify a clear Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Prioritize core functionality
- Defer or cut low-value features intentionally

> **Rule of thumb:** A small, complete project beats a large, unfinished one.

---

## 4. Teamwork Is the Project

Capstones are team-based for a reason.

**You will encounter:**
- Different skill levels
- Different work styles
- Scheduling conflicts

**You are expected to practice:**
- Clear task ownership
- Respectful communication
- Sharing knowledge through documentation

> **Warning sign:** "If I don't do it myself, it won't get done."

---

## 5. Communication Matters More Than You Think

**You must communicate with:**
- Teammates
- Instructors
- Reviewers or stakeholders

**Good communication includes:**
- Regular status updates
- Early warning when something is blocked
- Clear explanations of technical work

> **Surprise is bad. Transparency is good.**

---

## 6. Documentation Is Not Optional

Documentation is part of the deliverable.

**At a minimum, expect to produce:**
- A clear README
- Setup and run instructions
- Architecture overview
- Known limitations and assumptions

> **Industry truth:** Undocumented work is considered unfinished work.

---

## 7. Use Version Control Like a Professional

Git (or equivalent) is mandatory.

**You should:**
- Commit frequently
- Use branches
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Avoid last-minute "dump everything" commits

> **Your commit history tells the story of your project.**

---

## 8. Testing Is About Confidence, Not Perfection

**Testing helps you answer:**
- What works?
- What doesn't?
- What happens at the edges?

**Expect to:**
- Test core functionality
- Demonstrate predictable behavior
- Explain known failure cases

> **You don't need perfect tests—just honest ones.**

---

## 9. AI Tools Are Allowed — But You Are Responsible

Using AI tools is acceptable and expected.

**However:**
- You must understand what you submit
- You must be able to explain your code
- You must validate AI-generated outputs

> **Unacceptable answer:** "The AI wrote it."

---

## 10. Think About Security, Ethics, and Responsibility

Even student projects have real implications.

**You should consider:**
- Data privacy
- Authentication and access control
- Bias or hallucinations in AI systems
- Clear boundaries on what the system can and cannot do

> **If the system is unsure, it should say so.**

---

## 11. Failure Is Part of the Learning Outcome

Not everything will work as planned.

**What matters is:**
- Did you identify the problem?
- Did you adapt?
- Did you document what you learned?

> **A perfect project is not required. Growth and reflection are.**
