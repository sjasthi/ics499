# ICS 499 — Assignment 3: AI / LLM Topic Exploration & Presentation

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to help students develop the ability to quickly learn, explore, experiment with, and explain modern **AI and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies**. Students will independently research and hands-on explore an assigned AI/LLM topic and then teach the class through a structured presentation.

---

## Assignment Description

Each student is assigned **one AI / LLM-related topic** (from the curated topic list). You are expected to:

- Research the topic and understand its purpose and real-world relevance  
- Explore related tools, frameworks, or models  
- Perform **hands-on experimentation** (where applicable)  
- Prepare a professional presentation and present it to the entire class  

---

## Mandatory Presentation Requirements

- Presentation length: **12 to 16 slides** (including title and references)  
- **Live presentation is mandatory** to receive credit  
- Slides must be **clear, structured, and visually readable**  
- Include **technical depth + conceptual clarity + demos/examples**

---

## Suggested Presentation Outline

Your presentation should include (but is not limited to):

1. Title Slide (Topic name, your name)  
2. Introduction & Motivation – Why is this topic important?  
3. Problem Statement – What problem does this topic solve?  
4. Core Concept Explanation – Key ideas and terminology  
5. Architecture / Workflow Diagram  
6. Key Features / Capabilities  
7. Underlying Models / Algorithms / Techniques  
8. Tools / Libraries / Platforms Used  
9. Hands-on Demo / Experiment / Screenshots  
10. Real-world Use Cases & Applications  
11. Advantages & Benefits  
12. Challenges, Risks, or Limitations
