# ICS 499 -- Assignment 2: DevOps Tool Exploration & Presentation

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to help students develop the ability to quickly learn, explore, experiment with, and articulate new DevOps tools. Students will independently research and hands-on explore an assigned DevOps tool and then teach the class about that tool through a formal presentation.

## Assignment Description

Each student will be assigned one DevOps-related tool. You are expected to:

- Research the tool and understand its purpose and use cases
- Install or access the tool (locally, cloud, or demo version where applicable)
- Experiment with the tool through hands-on usage
- Prepare a presentation and present it to the entire class

## Mandatory Presentation Requirements

- Presentation length: 12 to 16 slides (excluding title and references slides)
- Presentation is mandatory to receive credit
- Students will receive credit ONLY if they present to the class
- Slides must be clear, structured, and visually readable

## Suggested Presentation Outline

Your presentation should include (but is not limited to):

1. Title slide (Tool name, your name)
2. What problem does this tool solve?
3. Where does it fit in the DevOps lifecycle?
4. Key features and capabilities
5. Architecture or high-level workflow
6. Installation or setup overview
7. Demo or screenshots of the tool in action
8. Typical real-world use cases
9. Pros and cons
10. Comparison with similar tools
11. Challenges or limitations
12. What you learned from exploring this tool
13. Why this tool is important for DevOps engineers
14. References

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this assignment, students will:

- Develop self-learning and exploration skills
- Gain experience quickly picking up unfamiliar tools
- Improve technical communication and presentation skills
- Learn to explain complex tools clearly to peers
- Build confidence in teaching technical concepts

## Grading Criteria (25 Points)

1. Depth of Research & Understanding (8 points)
   - Clear understanding of the tool and its purpose

2. Hands-on Exploration & Experimentation (7 points)
   - Evidence of actual tool usage (demo, screenshots, examples)

3. Presentation Quality & Organization (5 points)
   - Slide clarity, structure, flow, and timing

4. Communication & Teaching Effectiveness (5 points)
   - Ability to clearly explain and answer questions

Note: Students must present their assigned topic to the entire class (10 to 15 minutes) to get the credit. Submitting a video recording or dropping the files is not good enough!

## Important Notes

- Non-presented assignments will receive ZERO credit
- Reading directly from slides is discouraged
- Cite all external references
- Be prepared to answer questions from classmates and instructor
